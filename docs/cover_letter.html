					Dear Professor Sansone,
				</p>
				<p>
					as a web developer and long-time admirer of the University of Oxford, I was thrilled to find a vacancy for a web developer position at the Data Readiness Group of the Oxford e-Research Centre. <br>
					I first learned about the Open Science concept during an online lecture of the University of Konstanz in 2021. One of its core principles - to publish as much as possible as early as possible and to keep the research data FAIR - is particularly interesting for me, as it coincides with the principles of the Open Source movement, of which I am an enthusiast and which itself is one of the elements of Open Science.<br>
					As a public service employee in Germany, I am encouraged to use open source software wherever reasonable and also to publish my own code as part of the Public Money, Public Code initiative. I also share the source code of my private projects as open source using the MIT licence.<br>
					I would like to contribute more intensively to the Open Science movement by designing and building user-friendly web applications for this community. Working on the further development of FAIR resources, like the FAIR Cookbook, gives me the chance to do that, as providing powerful, state-of-the art platforms for research data management is an important component for the dissemination and acceptance of Open Science. As a web developer, I am excited by the task of writing high-quality software and making efficient use of the modern possibilities of software engineering. Therefore, I would be elated to join the Data Readiness Group of the Oxford e-Research Centre as a web developer and I hereby apply for this position.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have been working as a web developer at the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria for four years, designing and programming new web applications, frontend and backend for the organisation's Drupal-based intranet. Thereby I can apply and constantly expand my knowledge of PHP, HTML as well as SCSS. Since the intranet is used by representatives of diverse professional groups, I am well-acquainted with taking into account the needs of different stakeholders in each project. It is my goal to make the intranet a tool that facilitates the users' daily work. Hence in my coding I am committed to processing and presenting the data in such a way that it is easy for users to find or access.<br>
					I am also passionate about programming in my spare time, where I administrate websites, or create new websites or programs using Ruby, Ruby on Rails as well as JavaScript.<br>
					Furthermore, I continue to educate myself by taking online courses on web programming topics and enjoy it immensely. Currently, I am learning Action Cable - a Rails library for creating performant real-time applications.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am aware that some of the libraries and frameworks mentioned in the job description, such as Vuetify or Vue.js, are new to me and I have little or no experience with them. However, the tasks of the position are extremely fascinating for me, I am very motivated and from previous experience I know that I am able to quickly and thoroughly familiarize myself with new topics and dedicate myself to them with a lot of energy and commitment.<br>
					I also am a communicative person, always work in a structured, organized manner and can prioritize very well.
				</p>

				<p>
					I am convinced that as a skilled, passionate web developer I can intensively support the Data Readiness Group at the Oxford e-Research Centre. I am looking forward to new tasks in an exciting international  environment, which will in equal measure challenge me and give me room for further growth.
				</p>

				<p>Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. I would be glad to share more about my skills and experiences with you and to learn more about this position.</p>
				<p>
					Yours sincerely,
				</p>

				<p>
					Anna Förster
