					Dear Ms. Daniels,
				</p>
				<p>
					As an experienced web developer and a long-time admirer of the Harvard University, I was thrilled to learn of the vacancy for a Front End Developer position at the Bloomberg Center for Cities at Harvard Kennedy School. My commitment to advance digitalisation for societal benefit make the Bloomberg Center for Cities an ideal environment for me to apply my skills and make a meaningful impact. I am inspired by the center's interdisciplinary approach and the opportunity to collaborate with experts from diverse fields, including urban planning and data science. <br>
					In my current role as a Web Developer, I am responsible for writing high-quality software and leveraging the cutting-edge possibilities of software engineering. As this work excites me genuinely, I would be elated to join the team at Bloomberg Center for Cities in the role of a Front End Developer and I submit my application with great enthusiasm.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reviewing the job description, I was delighted to find that my skills and experiences align closely with the requirements of the role. My resume, available at <a class="resume-link" href="https://bluepeony.github.io/cv/" target="_blank">bluepeony.github.io/cv</a>, provides a comprehensive overview of my expertise, which includes:
					<ol>
						<li><i>Proficiency in Front End Development</i>: For the past five years, I have been working as a Web Developer for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria, where I design and program new web applications for the organisation’s Drupal-based intranet, both frontend and backend. In doing so, I apply and continuously expand my knowledge of PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am committed, via my coding, to process and present data in such a way that it is easy for users to find or access. I have a keen ability to work in a structured, organised manner while shifting or prioritising on the fly as needed.</li>
						<li><i>Collaborative Approach</i>: As representatives from diverse professional groups use the intranet, I am well-acquainted with taking into account the needs of different stakeholders in each project. My goal is to make the intranet a tool that effectively facilitates the users’ daily work. </li>
						<li><i>Communication and Presentation</i>: Furthermore I hold consultation hours, create easy-to-understand guides and screencasts to best support our non-technical users with intranet-related questions.</li>
						<li><i>Curiosity and Eagerness to Learn</i>: My interest and passion for programming extend into my spare time, where I administer or create new websites and programs using Wordpress, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and JavaScript. Moveover, I continue to educate myself by taking online courses on web programming topics and enjoy it immensely! Currently, I am learning GraphQL - an open-source query language for APIs that can offer an alternative to REST.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					Specific to the job description, I admit that some of the tools outlined, such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Final Cut Pro, Pardot or Salesforce Marketing Cloud, are new to me with little or no experience. However, the tasks this position is responsible for fascinate me greatly, I am very motivated and from previous experience I know that I would be able to quickly and thoroughly familiarise myself with new topics and dedicate myself to them with a high level of energy and commitment. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I am eager to contribute my problem-solving mindset and creativity to the Bloomberg Center for Cities' mission of leveraging technology for urban innovation. Designing and developing user-friendly, efficient web applications allows me the chance to do just that, as providing state-of-the-art digital solutions is crucial in fostering innovation, empowering communities, and driving positive change in cities worldwide.
					<br>
					As a skilled and dedicated Web Developer, I would bring practical support to the team at the Bloomberg Center for Cities at Harvard University. I am keen to take on new tasks in an exciting, international environment that will challenge me and allow for additional growth. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. I would be glad to share more about my skills and experiences with you and learn more about this position in a personal interview.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yours sincerely,
				</p>
